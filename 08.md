## INTRO

Your server is now running two services: the *sshd* (Secure Shell Daemon) service that you use to login; and the Apache2 web server. Both of these services are generating logs as you and others access your server - and these are text files which we can analyse using some simple tools.

Plain text files are a key part of "the Unix way" and there are many small "tools" to allow you to easily edit, sort, search and otherwise manipulate them. Today we'll use `grep`, `cat`, `more`, `less`, `cut`, `awk` and `tail` to slice and dice your logs.

The `grep` command is famous for being extremely powerful and handy, but also because its "nerdy" name is typical of Unix/Linux conventions.

## TASKS

* Dump out the complete contents of a file with `cat` like this: `cat /var/log/apache2/access.log`
* Use `less` to open the same file, like this: `less /var/log/apache2/access.log` - and move up and down through the file with your arrow keys, then use "q" to quit.
* Using `vi`, look at a file and practice moving around using *G* (go to bottom) and *gg* (go to top.) 
* Still in `vi` use */GET* + enter to search for GET. Once you see the first match, hit *n* to see the next match, no enter needed. Use *N* to see the prior match, also no enter needed.
* View recent logins and `sudo` usage by viewing `/var/log/auth.log` with `less`, `more`, or `vi`.
* Look at just the tail end of the file with `tail /var/log/apache2/access.log` (yes, there's also a `head` command!)
* Follow a log in real-time with: `tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log`
  * Your prompt will not come back since you're watching the log change
  * To make it more obvious that some new log has appeared, hit enter a couple of times to put blank lines on your screen
  * Visit your website with your browser and see the log entries that appear
  * When done, hit `<ctrl>-c` to exit the `tail` command

### Pipes 

* You can take the output of one command and "pipe" it in as the input to another by using the `|` (pipe) symbol
* So, dump out a file with `cat`, but pipe that output to `grep` with a search term - like this: `cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "Disconnect"`
* To see the same output without needing a pipe, you can use `grep "Disconnect" /var/log/auth.log`
* Piping allows you to narrow your search, e.g. `grep "Disconnect" /var/log/auth.log | grep "root"`
* Use the `cut` command to select out most interesting portions of each line by specifying "--delimiter" (the thing that separates the fields) and "--fields" (the fields you want)
  * The delimiter in the example below is a space character so each time a space appears it creates a new field. Think of a field as a new column in a spreadsheet.
  * The fields specify the position number of the columns that you want to display.
  * `grep "Disconnect" /var/log/auth.log | grep "root" | cut --fields 10- --delimiter " "` shows field 10 onwards, where the delimiter between fields is the " " character.
* Searching and picking out specific fields can be very useful in extracting useful information from log data. These commands are also easy to automate and insert into reports compared with working with columns in a spreadsheet or database.
* Use the `-v` option to invert the selection and find attempts to login with other users: `grep "Disconnect" /var/log/auth.log | grep -v "root"`
  * There may not be any other user attempts in this log file
  * It may help to search `/var/log/auth.log.1` in addition-- this is the prior week's log

### Redirect output to a file

The output of any command can be "redirected" to a file with the ">" operator. The command: `ls -ltr > listing.txt` wouldn't list the directory contents to your screen, but instead redirect into the file "listing.txt" (creating that file if it didn't exist, or overwriting the contents if it did).

Try this:
  * cd
  * ls -lrt > my-files.txt
  * ls -l

You should see `my-files.txt`. Look at its contents with:
  * cat `my-files.txt`

How about redirecting those log searches from earlier to files for permanent storage or for sending to other people if needed?

`grep "Disconnect" /var/log/auth.log | grep "root" > auth-log-report.txt`

The new `auth-log-report.txt` file can be viewed with `more`, `vi`, etc.

## POSTING YOUR PROGRESS

Re-run the command to list all the IP's that have unsuccessfully tried to login to your server as *root* - but this time, use the the ">" operator to redirect it to the file: `~/attackers.txt`. You might like to share and compare with others doing the course how heavily you're "under attack"!

## EXTENSION

* See if you can extend your filtering of `auth.log` to select just the IP addresses, then pipe this to `sort`, and then further to `uniq` to get a list of all those IP addresses that have been "auditing" your server security for you.
  * One example: `grep "Disconnected" /var/log/auth.log | grep "root"| cut --fields 12 --delimiter " " | sort | uniq --count`
* Advanced exercise: sort by IP address while keeping the complete text of each log entry.
* Investigate the `awk` and `sed` commands. When you're having difficulty figuring out how to do something with `grep` and `cut`, then you may need to step up to using these. Googling for "linux sed tricks" or "awk one liners" will get you many examples.
  * `grep "Disconnect" /var/log/auth.log | grep "root" | awk --field-separator " " '{print $11}' | sort | uniq --count`
* Aim to learn at least one simple useful trick with both `awk` and `sed`
