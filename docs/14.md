## INTRO

Today you're going to set-up another user on your system. You're going to imagine that this is a help-desk person that you trust to do just a few simple tasks:

* check that the system is running
* check disk space with: `df -h`

...but you also want them to be able to reboot the system, because you believe that "turning it off and on again" resolves most problems :-)

You'll be covering a several new areas, so have fun!

## ADDING A USER

Choose a name for your new user - we'll use "helen" in the examples, so to add this new user:

`sudo adduser helen`

(Names are case-sensitive in Linux, so "Helen" would be a completely different user)

The "adduser" command works very slightly differently in each distro - if it didn't ask you for a password for your new user, then set it manually now by:

`sudo passwd helen`

You will now have a new entry in the simple text database of users: `/etc/passwd` (check it out with: `less`), and a group of the same name in the file: `/etc/group`. A hash of the password for the user is in: `/etc/shadow` (you can read this too if you use "sudo" - check the permissions to see how they're set. For obvious reasons it's not readable to just everyone).

If you're used to other operating systems it may be hard to believe, but these simple text files are the whole Linux user database and you could even create your users and groups by directly editing these files - although this isn't normally recommended.

Additionally, `adduser` will have created a home directory, `/home/helen` for example, with the correct permissions.

Login as your new user to confirm that everything works. Now while logged in as this user try to run `reboot` - then `sudo reboot`.

## CLEVER SUDO TRICKS

Your new user is just an ordinary user and so can't use `sudo` to run commands with elevated privileges - until we set them up. We could simply add them to a group that's pre-defined to be able to use sudo to do _anything_ as root - but we don't want to give "helen" quite that amount of power.

Use `ls -l` to look at the permissions for the file: `/etc/sudoers`  This is where the magic is defined, and you'll see that it's tightly controlled, but you should be able to view it with: `sudo less /etc/sudoers` You want to add a new entry in there for your new user, and for this you need to run a special utility: `visudo`

To run this, you can temporarily "become root" by running:

`sudo -i`

Notice that your prompt has changed to a "#"

Now simply run  `visudo` to begin editing `/etc/sudoers` - typically this will use `nano`.

All lines in `/etc/sudoers` beginning with "#" are optional comments. You'll want to add some lines like this:

```ini
# Allow user "helen" to run "sudo reboot"
# ...and don't prompt for a password
#
helen ALL = NOPASSWD:/sbin/reboot
```

You can add these line in wherever seems reasonable. The `visudo` command will automatically check your syntax, and won't allow you to save if there are mistakes - because a corrupt sudoers file could lock you out of your server!

Type `exit` to remove your magic hat and become your normal user again - and notice that your prompt reverts to: `$`

## TESTING

Test by logging in as your test user and typing: `sudo reboot`
Note that you can "become" helen by:

`sudo su helen`

If your ssh config allows login only with public keys, you'll need to setup `/home/helen/.ssh/authorized_keys` - including getting the owner and permissions correct. A little challenge of your understanding of this area!

## MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER

This might be a good time to make your life a little bit easier. Use `sudoedit` to reconfigure sudo so you don't need to enter your password when running "sudo" any more. There are several ways to do this but the above `NOPASSWD:` directive will be important to all of them.
