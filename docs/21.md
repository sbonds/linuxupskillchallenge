What is this madness – surely the course was for just 20 days?

Yes, but hopefully you’ll go on learning, so here’s a few suggestions for directions that you might take

## Play with your server

You’re familiar with the server you used during the course, so keep working with it. Maybe uninstall Apache2 and install NGINX, a competing webserver. Keep a running stat on ssh “attackers”. Whatever. A free AWS will last a year, and a $5/mo server should be something you can easily justify.

## Add services that you’ll use

You should now be capable of following tutorials on installing and running your own instance of Minecraft, Wordpress, WireGuard VPN, or Mediawiki. Expect to have some problems – it's all good experience!

## Extend your learning

Stop browsing articles on Gnome, KDE or i3 – and start checking out any articles like “*20 Linux commands every sysadmin should know*”. Try these out, delve into the options. Like learning a foreign vocabulary, you will only be able to use these “words” if you know them!

## Certs

If you’re looking to do Linux professionally, and you don’t have an impressive CV or resume already, then you should be aiming at getting a cert. There are really just three certs/tracks that count:

* [CompTIA Linux+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/linux)

* [LPI LPIC-1: Linux Administrator](https://wiki.lpi.org/wiki/Main_Page) – Very extensive description of the coverage of their various certs/courses.

* [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/all-certifications-exams) – You could spend a lot of time and money here! (but it might well pay off)

Even if you don’t want/need certs, the outline of the topics in these references can give you a good idea of areas to focus on in your self-learning.
