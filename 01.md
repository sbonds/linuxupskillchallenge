## INTRO

You should now have a remote server setup running the latest Ubuntu Server LTS (Long Term Support) version. You alone will be administering it. To become a fully-rounded Linux server admin you should become comfortable working with different versions of Linux, but for now Ubuntu is a good choice.

Once you have reached a level of comfort at the command-line then you'll find your skills transfer not only to all the standard Linux variants, but also to Android, Apple's OSX, OpenBSD, Solaris and IBM AIX. Throughout the course you'll be working on Linux - but in fact most of what is covered is applicable to any system in the "UNIX family" - and the major differences between them are with their graphic user interfaces such as Gnome, Unity, KDE etc - none of which you'll be using!

Although there is a "root" user, you will be logging in and working from the user account that you setup. Because this is a member of the group "sudo" it is able to run commands "as root" by preceding them with "sudo".

## YOUR TASKS TODAY:

* Connect and login remotely to your server
* Run a few simple simple commands to check the status of your server
* Change your password

## INSTRUCTIONS

The industry standard remote login for Linux and UNIX systems is SSH ("Secure SHell"). The SSH server software runs on our Linux host and we use an SSH client to connect. There are lots of options on SSH clients. So many that it can be confusing to know which one to use. The choice largely depends on the operating system of whatever you're using to connect.

No matter what you're using, you will need the IP address of the server you're connecting to. Finding this varies by cloud provider, so refer back to the "Day 0" document you used for information on finding this. It's one of the very last steps.

### Windows

GUI SSH clients for Windows

* PuTTY
* MobaXterm

### MacOS

TODO: Screenshots of opening a terminal and running the ssh command from the command line

On an MacOS machine you'll normally access the command line via Terminal.app - it's in the Utilities sub-folder of Applications.

GUI SSH clients for MacOS:

* Terminal.app
* iTerm2

### Linux/UNIX

If you're using any Linux or Unix system then you can simply open up a local command line session and use your command-line *ssh* client like this:

`ssh user@<ip address>`

For example:

`ssh support@192.123.321.99`

On Linux distributions with a menu you'll typically find the terminal under "Applications menu -> Accessories -> Terminal", "Applications menu -> System -> Terminal" or "Menu -> System -> Terminal Program (Konsole)"- or you can simply search for your terminal application. In many cases Ctrl+Alt+T will also bring up a terminal windows.

## First connect warning

Regardless of which client you use, the first time you connect to your server, you may receive a warning that you're connecting to a new server - and be asked if you wish to "cache the host key". Do this. Now, if you get a warning in future connections it means that either: (a) you are being fooled into connecting to a different machine or (b) someone may be trying a "man in the middle" attack.

So, now login to your server as your user - and remember that Linux is case-sensitive regarding user names, as well as passwords.

Once logged in, notice that the "command prompt" that you receive ends in  *$* - this is the convention for an ordinary user, whereas the "root" user with full administrative power has a *#* prompt.

Try these simple commands:

`ls -al`

`uptime`

`free`

`df -h`

`uname -a`

## Change your password

Now is a good time to ensure that your password is very strong and unique - i.e. At least 10 characters - because your server is fully exposed to bots that will be continuously attempting to break in. While it's significantly less likely that your non-default (e.g. not "root") account will be targeted, it's still possible.

If you created a very strong password for your non-root user, this step is optional, though still good practice.

Use the *passwd* command to change your password. To do this, create/generate a new, secure password, then simply type *passwd*, press "Enter" and give your current password when prompted, then the new one you've chosen, confirm it - and then WRITE IT DOWN somewhere.

## Practice copying text out of your SSH session

It's very handy to be able to copy and paste text between your remote session and your local desktop, so spend some time getting confident with how to do this in your setup. The paste method varies by SSH client and in many cases is configurable within the SSH client.

Open up a local text editor (e.g. Notepad++, Visual Studio Code) and copy some text from your screen into the text editor.

## Practice copying text into your SSH session

In your text editor add "ls -al" and copy the text. Paste it onto a prompt and press enter.

Try adding a blank line after "ls -al" in your text editor and copying the command plus the start of the next line. Paste that into a prompt. What happened that was different?

(It should have copied the "enter" too, making it unnecessary to type enter yourself. Is this a good thing? Bad thing? Both?)

## Log out

Log out by typing *exit* or another method you've used before and enjoy.

## Customize SSH client

You'll be spending a lot of time in your SSH client, so it pays to spend some time customizing it. At the very least try "black on white" and "green on black" - and experiment with different monospaced fonts, ("Ubuntu Mono" is free to download, and very nice).

## POSTING YOUR PROGRESS

Regularly posting your progress can be a helpful motivator. Feel free to post to the subreddit a small introduction of yourself, and your Linux background for your "classmates" - and notes on how each day has gone.

Of course, also drop in a note if you get stuck or spot errors in these notes.

## WRAP

You now have the ability to login remotely to your own server. Perhaps you might now try logging in from home and work - even from your smartphone! - using an ssh client app such as "Termux". As a server admin you'll need to be comfortable logging in from all over. You can also potentially use JavaScript ssh clients (search for "consolefish"), or from a cybercafe - but these options involve putting more trust in third-parties than most sysadmins would be comfortable with when accessing production systems.

## A NOTE ON "HARDENING"

Your server is protected by the fact that its security updates are up to date, and that you've set Long Strong Unique passwords - or are using public keys. While exposed to the world, and very likely under continuous attack, it should be perfectly secure. Next week we'll look at how we can view those attacks, but for now it's simply important to state that while it's OK to read up on "SSH hardening", things such as changing the default port and `fail2ban` are unnecessary and unhelpful when we're trying to learn - and you are perfectly safe without them.
