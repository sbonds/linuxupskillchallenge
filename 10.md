## INTRO

Linux has a rich set of features for running scheduled tasks. One of the key attributes of a good sysadmin is getting the computer to do your work for you (sometimes misrepresented as laziness!) -  and a well configured set of scheduled tasks is key to keeping your server running well.

## CRON

Each user potentially has their own set of scheduled tasks which can be listed with the `crontab` command (list out your user crontab entry with `crontab -l` and then that for *root* with `sudo crontab -l` ). Chances are neither you nor root has a crontab at this point.

There's also a system-wide crontab defined in `/etc/crontab` - use `less` to look at this. Here's example, along with an explanation:

```text
SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user  command
17 * * * *   root cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6 * * *   root test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6 * * 7   root test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6 1 * *   root test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
```

Lines beginning with "#" are comments, so `# m h dom mon dow user command` defines the meanings of the columns.

Here's what the above file means:

The first line says that at 17mins after every hour, on every day, the credential for "root" will be used to run any scripts in the `/etc/cron.hourly` folder - and similar logic kicks off daily, weekly and monthly scripts. This is a tidy way to organise things, and many Linux distributions use this approach. It does mean we have to look in those `/etc/cron.*` folders to see what's actually scheduled.

On your system type: `ls /etc/cron.daily` - you'll see something like this (yours will probably be slightly different):

```text
apache2  apt  aptitude  bsdmainutils  locate  logrotate  man-db  mlocate  standard  sysklog
```

Each of these files is a script or a shortcut to a script to do some regular task, and they're run in alphabetic order by `run-parts`. So in this case *apache2* will run first. Use `less` with the appropriate full pathname for the script to view some of the scripts on your system - many will look very complex and are best left well alone, but others may be just a few lines of simple commands.

Look at the articles in the resources section - you should be aware of `at` and `anacron` but are not likely to use them in a server.

Google for "logrotate", and then look at the logs in your own server to see how they've been "rotated". Log rotation helps ensure that your server doesn't fill up with logs over time. The logs (and the rotated logs) are in `/var/log` directory and the rotated files will show up with a `.1` extension or `.2.gz`. If you want to save more information you can reconfigure `logrotate` to keep more copies of logs.

## SYSTEMD TIMERS

All major Linux distributions now include "systemd". As well as starting and stopping services, this can *also* be used to run tasks at specific times via "timers". See which ones are already configured on your server with:

`systemctl list-timers`

Use the links in the RESOURCES section to read up about how these timers work.
